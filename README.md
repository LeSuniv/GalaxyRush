# Galaxy-Rush
Galaxy Rush is a WPF game coded in C# on Visual Studio. It is an endless runner game where the player must dodge obstacles aboard his ship. Like Flappy Bird, the player must press space to change direction and collect power-ups that will make him invincible for a short time. The obstacles will evolve over time, from asteroids to OVNIs and will also be more and more numerous. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible, and if you want to see what the end of the game looks like, you can press the invincibility key.
